Wills
- Dying without a will is known as dying intestate, govt laws will decide how your assets are distributed

#### Managing a Deceased Estate
Deceased estate is after ded

The estate of a deceased person cannot be dealt with til a grant of representation is obtained
- By probate through a will
- Or by letters of administration (through other means)
		
Process starts by the executor publicly notifing the intention to deal with assets (telling others to get their liabilities repaid)
- Following the lapse of the statutory time period (of this notice), an application can be made to gain a probate with the court
	
Probate
- Need a grant of probate to take possession of the estate assets by the executor
- Formal process that a will is proved, registered with the court. The court verifies that proper administration is completed.
- A probate parchment is issued (a scroll with the will attached)
	- Institutions may need to see the probate before releasing the assets to the executor
	
Letters of Administration
- Where probate cannot be obtained, the court approves someone to administer the estate by Letters of Administration.
- Typically, the principal beneficiary or nearest next of kin applies to be the estate admin, granted a letter of administration.
- Everything else follows through with the new administrator acting as the executor
	
Intestacy
- Full intestacy occurs when
	- A will is not made
	- A will is made but cannot be admitted to probate (due to duress, testamentary capacity)
			
- Partial intestacy occurs when
	- Not disposing all estate assets
	- Invalid bequest
	- Beneficiaries died before
	- Or doctrine of forfeiture - beneficiary criminally responsible for the death of the testator
		
Rules of intestacy
- Next of kin is appointed the administrator
- Administer following the statuary rules of intestacy
- Governed by marital and blood relationships
- Depends on the state
- In VIC, determined by a family tree and distribute as
	- To spouse, children
	- Neither implies to any living next of kin, grandparents…
	- Otherwise, to the Crown

Challenging wills
- Estate asset distributions can be challenged by claimants
	- Must reach a specific criteria
- Wills are vulnerable to the client's financial creditors	
- The general rule is that a person can leave assets to whomever they wish
- Wills can be challenged on the grounds of
	- Lack of testamentary capacity
	- Undue duress
	- Incorrect execution
- The estate can pay out the legal costs of contesting a will (within 6 month of the probate), unless the challenge is not deemed appropriate.
	
- Family law imposes a responsibility to make provision for family
- If inadequate provisions are made, a person can contest under the TFM claims
- TFM limited to the people
	- Surviving spouse
	- Children
	- Parents
	- Divorced spouse who is receiving or entitled to receive maintenance
	
- Legislation granting the right to challenge the estate to people who can establish a right of maintenance by the testator (the testator must care of the person),
	- Estranged children
	- Unknown children
	- Long term carers of testators
- Only estate assets are challengeable, non-estate assets cannot be challenged
	

#### Tax Implications
Allows executors up to 3 years to finalize an estate

The estate itself is considered a taxpayer individual, with income from the estate assets paying income tax using the estate's MTR

Essentially a concession on income from estates (As the first 18000ish is technically tax-free)
	
	
#### Powers of Attorney (PoA)
A legal document where the donor (client) appoints another person (attorney) to act as their agent, as to
- Sign contracts, manage affairs, medical decisions

PoA operates only during the donor's lifetime.

Can be a general PoA, enduring, or power of guardianship
- General PoA ceases to operate if donor's mental capacity to act
- Enduring PoA continues to operate
- Power of guardianship decides where and how the donor lives
		
PoA gives the right for the attorney to undertake legal, financial matters that donors can undertake
- Donor must have sound mind to execute (use) a PoA
- Donors can execute more than one PoA
	
PoA operates under state law, and may need to be registered
	
PoA cannot
- Make a will
- Undertake illegal acts
- Delegate the power to another
- Exercise the donor's trustee power
- Make lifestyle decisions for the donor, unless explicitly as in the medical case
		
		
#### Trust
Trusts can have the form of unit trusts and discretionary trusts.

A fixed, unit trust gives beneficiaries a fixed entitlement to the distributions and capital in proportion to the units held, like shares in a company
	
A discretionary trust gives beneficiaries entitlement to get trust distribution but not the right to receive the capital (right to income, but not ownership)
	
Estate planning trusts are often discretionary trusts:
- Living, inter vivos trust, family trusts
- Testamentary trust, established after death of testator by will
		
Family trusts structure
- An tax and estate planning vehicle
- Contains assets contributed to the FT and income from assets earned in the FT's name
- Trustee holds the assets on behalf of the beneficiaries
- Income is distributed to beneficiaries at the discretion of the trustee (meaning that the trustee has full power in determining when the income is distributed)
- Tax benefits for tax is taken at the beneficiary's MTR


Testamentary trusts
- TT used to provide income for
	- Minors or members with disabilities
	- Asset protection to beneficiaries
	- Maintaining social security, age pension income tests
	- Taxation benefits, income generated are excepted income
		- Where minors treated to have adult MTR, instead of the MTR of the trust setup people
				
- TT reduces the tax payment on income from the trust assets (estate), for the lower marginal tax rate using the trust or beneficiaries' MTR instead of the person who sets up the trust
	
- Be careful when setting up a trust, they may bring more problems than benefits if set up incorrectly

SMSF
- where the trust deed allows the accumulated benefits to be transfered bypassing probate, with
	- Directives of the trustee, Binding death nomination
	- Forfeiture into the fund's reserves
- The trustee directives with BDN is very strong is unlikely to be challenged, it is a way to protect against a will challenge
- The SMSF trust deed overwrites any instructions on the will
